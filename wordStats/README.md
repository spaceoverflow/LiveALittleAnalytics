### Hi I'm 12 and what is this?
**`userActivity.R`**

ask nagasaki boy for json file called `live-a-little` and do this:

```bash
# sorry I dont know how windows works
Rscript wordStats/userActivity.R /home/mad-e/Desktop/analystics/live-a-little
```

**wordUsage.R**

same stoy ask tamagotchi for `live-a-little` json and second arg needs to be word to get stats on.
NOOT: regex allowed and case is ignored (to change case thing go to source and lol)

```bash
# sorry I dont know how windows works
Rscript wordStats/wordUsage.R /home/mad-e/Desktop/analystics/live-a-little kanker
```
